# AlgoML

AlgoML (after *Algorand Modelling Language*) is a DSL for specifying Algorand smart contracts, which compiles into TEAL scripts.

## Use cases

Some use cases can be found [here](contracts).

## Compiler usage

To compile an AlgoML file into TEAL scripts, the following command can be used:
```console
caml.exe /path/to/input.aml [-o outprefix]
```

## Syntax highlighting

Syntax highlighting is supported on [vscode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RobertoPettinau.algoml-lang) 

## Credits

AlgoML has been designed by Roberto Pettinau and Massimo Bartoletti from the University of Cagliari, Italy.
