# Morra game

We specify a 2-players game where the players bet 1 ALGO each, and play according to the following rules:
1. player1 and player2 join the game by paying 1 ALGO each
2. for each turn of the game:
   - both players commits to a move (a number between 1 and 5), and reveal their guesses (any number)
   - if a player guesses the sum of the two moves, then she scores 1 point
3. after the last turn, the player with the highest score can redeem the whole pot.
